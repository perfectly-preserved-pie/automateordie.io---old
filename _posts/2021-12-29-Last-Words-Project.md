# The Website
[I made a website for my new project!](https://lastwords.fyi)

# The Idea
Back in 2014 or so, I found out that the Texas Department of Corrective Justice posts every single executed inmate's last statement [on their website](https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html). While definitely morbidly interesting, I also thought it would make a great coding project: what if I could automatically scrape each last statement along with the inmate's details and post them to a website? Furthermore, what if the website was *actually pretty*? I got my design inspiration from another Tumblr blog I had been following at the time, [A Sea of Quotes](https://www.aseaofquotes.com/). I wanted to apply that same look to these last statements.

# The Problem(s)
Well, it turns out that
1. Coding is fucking hard.
2. Web design is fucking hard.
  
And for the next 8 years or so, I floundered. I would get a burst of inspiration, work on the project, run into some coding obstacle, and then give up. 

![Rinse and repeat for years and years](https://i.imgur.com/qE2xj7x.jpg). 

But it was always in the back of my mind, nagging me. If I could just get the code right, I could do it.

## Until now...
I'm not sure what changed, but I think it was a combination of boredom, winter break, being sick and isolated, and my decent-enough PowerShell skills. That gave me enough confidence (and dare I say, the skill?!) to start the project again and this time **stick with it**.

# The Stack
My original intent was to use a combination of an AWS LightSail WordPress instance (for the website) and PowerShell (to scrape the TDCJ webpage). However, I didn't like many of the WordPress themes and found the whole concept just *too overwhelming*. So many options, themes, addons, blocks, etc. I wanted to keep it simple.
Additionally, I found that webscraping with PowerShell is pretty difficult; there weren't many HTML modules (unless you want to get into .NET) I could use. I'd like to think I'm pretty good with PS but this project was just so far out of my wheelhouse I was at a loss.

So I decided to use Python, which meant learning it from scratch. That was tough; coming from PowerShell, it was terribly confusing and foreign. But I had heard about modules like BeautifulSoup and Pandas which seemed perfect for my use case. Through a lot of copy and pasting from Reddit & StackOverflow (as is tradition), I managed to get a working proof-of-concept which gave me the hope and motiviation I needed to continue on.
For the website, I tried out Wix and SquareSpace, but again was overwhelemed with the options and the fact that I couldn't see how to create a layout that was optimized not for photos or long blog posts, but for quotes only. So I went back to my source of inspiration, A Sea of Quotes. And then it hit me - why not just use Tumblr? I already had an excellent example of a quote post theme done right. Plus, Tumblr had a pretty good API with [a Python client available](https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr).

# The Theme
Initially I started out with [Notations](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/8631) but thought it looked a little outdated. I wasn't satisified and kept looking.
After some further Googling, I stumbled upon [Zephyr](https://shoseii.tumblr.com/post/174988950529/zephyr-theme-14-live-preview-codes). The multi-column layout and infinite scrolling features were especially attractive. And the quote posts looked pretty clean as well.

# The Work
I had my work cut out for me. While [the base of the code had already been written for me](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64873079) (thank you, internet!), I still needed to do a number of additional things to make it so it would "fit" my new Tumblr blog. These things included:
* Using BeautifulSoup to grab specific links in an HTML table
* Removing all inmates that didn't have a last statement or declined to say one
* Working around Tumblr's API limits
* Iterating over batches of dataframes
* Using matplotlib to generate simple statistical plots of the data
* Using SymPy to *solve an algebraic equation* (woah! Haven't done that in a while!)

# The Journey
I've learned a ton about Pandas, dataframes, and Python in general. Even though the base of my code was simply copied & pasted, the work I did have to do was enough to send me on a Python journey and as a result I feel a little more confident in my coding skills. I have a much better handle on the various Python modules and I'm honestly in awe of the whole Python module ecosystem. It's amazing. There's a module for damn near everything. Pandas, Numpy, and BeautifulSoup have been an incredible help here.

Also, web scraping is _tough_. There's almost no coordination or standards from one page to the next; I spent so much time trying to account for every little deviation I was almost driven mad.

With that being said, it was fun! And incredibly frustrating at times! ðŸŒˆ

# The Code
[I've put up my code on my GitHub](https://github.com/perfectly-preserved-pie/lastwords). Feel free to flame me for my awful spaghetti code. I won't lie: I definitely coded with the intention of just making it work rather than making it work *well*.

I can finally close the 122 tabs I have open related to this project. Jesus.
